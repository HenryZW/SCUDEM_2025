This model simulates the influence of social factors on vaccination decisions within a fixed population. It is based on a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that describe the dynamics of five groups over time:

1. **Positive Influence (P)**: Individuals positively influenced to consider vaccination.
2. **Negative Influence (N)**: Individuals negatively influenced and leaning against vaccination.
3. **Undecided (U)**: Individuals who have yet to make a decision and are susceptible to social influence.
4. **Vaccinated (V)**: Individuals who have completed vaccination due to positive influence.
5. **Not Vaccinated (NV)**: Individuals who choose not to vaccinate due to negative influence.

The model tracks the transitions between these groups over time, with influence rates modulated by several key parameters:

- **\( \lambda_p \) and \( \lambda_n \)**: Rates of positive and negative influence, respectively, that move undecided individuals towards a decision.
- **Mood Factor (m)**: A factor amplifying the effect of both positive and negative influences.
- **Social Influence Factor (σ)**: Represents the additional strength of influence for each group relative to its proportion in the population, reflecting a social conformity effect.
- **Reconsideration Rates (δ, γ)**: Rates at which positively or negatively influenced individuals reconsider and return to an undecided state.
- **Conversion Rates (α_p, α_n)**: Rates at which positively and negatively influenced individuals become vaccinated or decide against vaccination, respectively.

This setup assumes a closed population where the total number of individuals remains constant. The differential equations update each group’s size over time based on these parameters, enabling an analysis of how social influence, mood, and reconsideration impact vaccination decisions within a community. 

This model’s output reveals the cumulative effect of positive and negative social messaging, providing insights into how different influences affect the rate of vaccination uptake and hesitancy over time.
